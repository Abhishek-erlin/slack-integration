# CrewAI Upgrade Tracking & Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of the article generation system in the slack-integration project, replicating the functionality from goosebump-crew with the latest CrewAI version.

## Current Status
- **Source Project**: goosebump-crew (CrewAI 0.105.0)
- **Target Project**: slack-integration (CrewAI 0.105.0)
- **Implementation Date**: October 6, 2025
- **Focus**: Blog article generation with research brief → full article workflow

## Key Requirements from Analysis

### API Endpoints (From Screenshots)
1. **POST** `/api/v1/article/research-brief` - Generate research brief for article
   - **Request Body**: `keyword`, `location`, `goal`, `company_id`, `user_id`, `selected_title`
   - **Response**: Research brief with article_id for next step

2. **POST** `/api/v1/article/generate-article/{article_id}` - Generate article from research brief
   - **Path Parameter**: `article_id` (integer)
   - **Response**: Generated article content

### Database Schema (From articles-db-schema.md)
```sql
create table public.articles (
  id bigint generated always as identity not null,
  keyword text null,
  location text null,
  goal text not null,
  content text not null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone not null default timezone ('utc'::text, now()),
  token_usage text null,
  uid uuid null,
  research_brief text null,
  company_id uuid null,
  shopify_article_id text null,
  research_brief_with_brandtone text null,
  article_type_id integer null,
  title text null,
  product_name text null,
  product_url_1 text null,
  product_url_2 text null,
  product_url_3 text null,
  description text null,
  topic text null,
  content_idea text null,
  product_keyword text null,
  media_context text null,
  publication_url text null,
  constraint articles_pkey1 primary key (id),
  constraint articles_article_type_id_fkey foreign KEY (article_type_id) references article_types (id),
  constraint articles_uid_fkey foreign KEY (uid) references auth.users (id)
);
```

## CrewAI 0.105.0 Implementation Details

### Known Issues & Solutions (From crewai-agent-truncation-issue.md)
- **Issue**: Agents sometimes provide meta-descriptions instead of actual research brief content
- **Solution**: Enhanced task configuration with anti-summarization instructions
- **Retry Logic**: Implemented comprehensive content validation with 3 retry attempts
- **Content Validation**: Minimum 1000 characters, required sections validation

### Architecture Pattern (3-Layer)
Following the established 3-layer architecture:
1. **Router Layer**: FastAPI routes with request/response handling
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic, CrewAI orchestration, retry mechanisms
3. **Repository Layer**: Database operations with Supabase

## CrewAI 0.105.0 Specific Configurations

### Agent Configuration (From source analysis)
```yaml
# Anti-summarization system message
system_message: |
  CRITICAL FINAL ANSWER BEHAVIOR:
  
  When providing your final answer, you MUST deliver the complete research brief content, not a summary or meta-description.
  
  ❌ NEVER say: "The comprehensive research brief contains..." or "The above is a complete research brief..."
  ❌ NEVER provide summaries or descriptions of your work
  ❌ NEVER abbreviate or shorten your final response
  
  ✅ ALWAYS provide the full research brief with all sections completely filled out
  ✅ Your final answer should start with "## COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS" not with explanatory text
  ✅ Include minimum 1000+ characters of actual research brief content to support ~1000 word articles
  ✅ Each section must contain detailed, actionable information
  
  Your final answer IS the research brief, not a description of it.
```

### Task Configuration
```yaml
expected_output: >
  CRITICAL FINAL ANSWER REQUIREMENTS:
  
  🚫 DO NOT SUMMARIZE OR PROVIDE META-DESCRIPTIONS OF YOUR WORK
  🚫 DO NOT say "The comprehensive research brief contains..." or similar summaries
  🚫 DO NOT abbreviate or shorten your response in any way
  
  ✅ RETURN THE ACTUAL, COMPLETE RESEARCH BRIEF CONTENT
  ✅ Your final answer must be the full research brief with all sections detailed
  ✅ Minimum 1000 characters of actual content (not summaries) to support ~1000 word articles
  ✅ Include ALL sections with complete information, not descriptions of sections
  
  IMPORTANT: Return the COMPLETE research brief with ALL sections fully filled out.
  Your final answer should be the actual research brief content, not a summary of what you created.
```

### Content Validation Logic
```python
# Enhanced validation patterns
placeholder_indicators = [
    "The detailed research brief provided above",
    "is ready, fully adapted", 
    "align with the brand's tone"
]

meta_description_indicators = [
    "The comprehensive research brief contains",
    "The above is a complete research brief", 
    "contains competitive analysis, a detailed content outline",
    "research insights with citations, and SEO strategy",
    "tailored for the article",
    "The research brief includes"
]

required_sections = [
    "## COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS",
    "## CONTENT OUTLINE", 
    "## RESEARCH INSIGHTS", 
    "## SEO STRATEGY"
]
```

## Agent Response Summary Tracking

### Research Brief Agent
- **Expected Output**: 1000+ character research brief with 4 required sections
- **Success Indicators**: All sections present, no meta-descriptions, substantial content
- **Failure Patterns**: Summarization, placeholder text, missing sections

### Content Generation Agent  
- **Expected Output**: Full article based on research brief
- **Success Indicators**: Complete article content, proper formatting
- **Integration**: Uses research_brief_with_brandtone from database

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Model validation
- Repository operations
- Service layer logic

### Integration Tests
- Full API workflow: research-brief → generate-article
- CrewAI agent execution
- Database operations

### API Tests
- Exact request/response format matching screenshots
- Error handling scenarios
- Performance benchmarks

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Key Metrics
- Content length validation (>1000 chars for research brief)
- Section presence validation (4/4 required sections)
- Retry attempt frequency
- Token usage tracking

### Debug Patterns
```
✅ SUCCESS: Valid research brief generated on attempt 1
Content length: 1847 characters
Required sections found: 4/4

❌ FAILURE: Meta-description detected, retrying...
Content length: 242 characters
Required sections found: 0/4
```
