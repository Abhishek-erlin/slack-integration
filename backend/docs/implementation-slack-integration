## Slack Integration Implementation Plan for Goosebump Crew
1. Overview
This plan outlines the steps to implement Slack integration within the Goosebump Crew project, enabling automated notifications for website analysis events. The integration will follow the 3-layer architecture pattern already established in the Goosebump Crew project.

2. Architecture Design
2.1 Component Architecture
The Slack integration will be implemented following the existing 3-layer architecture of the Goosebump Crew project:

Router Layer: FastAPI routes for Slack OAuth and notification endpoints
Service Layer: Business logic for Slack integration and notifications
Repository Layer: Database operations for Slack tokens and notification logs
2.2 New Components
We'll need to add the following components to the Goosebump Crew backend:

Routes:
slack_routes.py: OAuth and messaging endpoints
notification_routes.py: Notification management endpoints
trigger_routes.py: Event trigger endpoints
Services:
slack_service.py: Slack OAuth and messaging logic
notification_service.py: Notification delivery logic
trigger_service.py: Event trigger handling logic
Repositories:
slack_repository.py: Slack token storage and retrieval
notification_repository.py: Notification logs persistence
Models:
slack_models.py: Slack-related data models
notification_models.py: Notification system data models
2.3 Database Schema Extensions
We'll need to add two new tables to the Supabase database:

slack_integrations: Stores Slack OAuth tokens and user connections
Fields: id, user_id, slack_user_id, team_id, team_name, bot_user_id, access_token (encrypted), refresh_token (encrypted), scope, channel_id, connected_at, updated_at
notification_logs: Tracks notification delivery status
Fields: id, user_id, website_id, notification_type, message_content, delivery_status, channel_id, metadata, created_at, updated_at

3. Implementation Phases
Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup
3.1 Environment Configuration
Add required environment variables to Goosebump Crew's .env file:
SLACK_CLIENT_ID: From Slack app settings
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET: From Slack app settings
SLACK_REDIRECT_URI: OAuth callback URL
ENCRYPTION_KEY: 32-byte key for token encryption
Update config/config.py to include Slack configuration settings

3.2 Dependencies Installation
Add the required dependencies to pyproject.toml:

slack-sdk: Official Slack SDK for Python
slack-bolt: Framework for building Slack apps
cryptography: For token encryption/decryption
3.3 Database Migration
Create a migration script to add the new tables to the Supabase database:

slack_integrations table
notification_logs table with proper constraints
Phase 2: Data Models Implementation
2.1 Create Slack Models
Define Pydantic models in models/slack_models.py:

OAuthStartRequest: User ID for OAuth initiation
OAuthStartResponse: Auth URL and state
OAuthCallbackResponse: Success status and redirect URL
SlackIntegrationStatus: Connection status and details
MessageRequest: User ID, message, and optional channel
MessageResponse: Success status and message timestamp
2.2 Create Notification Models
Define Pydantic models in models/notification_models.py:

NotificationType: Enum for notification types (audit_complete, ai_visibility, competitor_analysis, system_alert)
Priority: Enum for notification priority (low, normal, high)
DeliveryStatus: Enum for delivery status (pending, delivered, failed)
NotificationRequest: User ID, website ID, notification type, context
NotificationResponse: Success status, message, notification ID
TriggerResponse: Success status, message, notification ID, delivery status
Phase 3: Repository Layer Implementation

Implement fallback messages for template formatting errors
Track delivery status in database
Handle errors gracefully
4.3 Create Trigger Service
Implement services/trigger_service.py with methods:

handle_event_trigger(): Process event and send notification
get_supported_events(): List available event types
test_trigger(): Test notification delivery
Key implementation details:

Map event types to message templates
Extract context from events
Track metadata for analytics
Phase 5: API Routes Implementation
5.1 Create Slack Routes
Implement routes/slack_routes.py with endpoints:

POST /api/v1/slack/oauth/start: Start OAuth flow
GET /api/v1/slack/oauth/callback: Handle OAuth callback
POST /api/v1/slack/send-message: Send direct message
GET /api/v1/slack/status/{user_id}: Check integration status
DELETE /api/v1/slack/disconnect/{user_id}: Remove integration

9. Conclusion
This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for integrating Slack notifications into the Goosebump Crew project. By following the existing 3-layer architecture and implementing proper security measures, we can create a robust and maintainable Slack integration that enhances the user experience by providing timely notifications about website analysis events.

The plan ensures clean separation of concerns, proper error handling, and security best practices while maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase. Once implemented, users will be able to receive real-time notifications about their website analyses directly in their Slack workspace.
